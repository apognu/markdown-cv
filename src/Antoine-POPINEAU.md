## Professional _experience_

### Smile, Open Source Solutions _Aug. 2010 / now_
#### Systems and networks engineer

Technically-wise, here is a sample of the subject I had to handle at Smile:

 * System deployment industrialization with Foreman and Puppet
 * Operator-grade global network authentication
 * High-availability platforms
 * Strong and two-way authentication systems
 * Network design for concurrent access through IPsec, SSL VPN and SSH tunnels

I also took part in the pre-sale process of the business unit and was project manager accross several projects.
