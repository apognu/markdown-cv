## Professional Experience

### Smile, Open Source Solutions - Aug. 2010 / now

Technically-wise, here is a sample of the subject I had to handle at Smile:

 * System deployment industrialization with Foreman and Puppet
 * Operator-grade global network authentication
 * High-availability platforms

I also took part in the pre-sale process of the business unit and was project manager accross several projects.
